# sha_lookupDB
Final project of my File and Database Processing class. Contains a locally hosted html that asks you to input the sha value of common passwords. The program will query the database that it makes and gives you the password from it, if it is stored in the database. 

Assignment requirements:
1) A php script that accomplishes 2 tasks. You will submit queries from your PHP script to accomplish these 2 tasks.

- Create a database with tables appropriate for storing your password / SHA pairs
  
- Populate those tables with the data provided in the three input text files: sha1_list.txt, sha224_list.txt, sha256_list.txt.
  
-	You may use any arrangement of tables that you want.
  
2)	An HTML page that accepts an input text box for the SHA hash value a user wants to look up.
3)	A PHP script that submits queries to the database created in step 1 to search for the SHA hash values submitted by the user.  This PHP script also displays a form to allow the user to search again for a new SHA hash value.
